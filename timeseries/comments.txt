Team 4 ecnc requested to turn in late 1 day.
Need to subtract point

Team 8 no longer exists.

1. Run create_checkout_file.py

This generates a checkout.sh file

2. Run checkout.sh file

This creates a student_solutions directory

3. We need to manually fix the student solutions directories before evaluating.

We need to all an `all_tests_head.py` to the `all_tests_tail.py` to get the file `all_tests.py`.
This basically means that some of the student directories are weird.
